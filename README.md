## Workflow

1. **Training the Face Recognition Model**
   - **Data Gathering**: Collect face images.
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize images.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features.
   - **Machine Learning Model**: Train a face recognition model (e.g., LBPH, Haar Cascades).
   - **Create ML Pipeline**: Integrate the training and testing process.

2. **Web Application**
   - **Flask (Backend)**: Web server for model integration.
   - **HTML & Bootstrap (Frontend)**: User interface.
   - **Model Integration**: Load the trained model for predictions.

3. **Deployment**
   - **Deploy Web App**: Host the app on **Heroku**.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: Face recognition and image processing.
- **Flask**: Backend web framework.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend styling.
- **Heroku**: Deployment platform.
