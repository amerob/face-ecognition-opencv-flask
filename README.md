1. **Training the Face Recognition Model**
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing images.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Extracting the faces and eigenimages.
   - 
   - **Machine Learning Model**:  Training the model using SVM and othe ML algorithms for classification, and evaluating it with ensemble methods for improved performance.

   - **Create ML Pipeline**: Integrating the training and testing process.

2. **Web Application**
   - **Flask (Backend)**: Web server for model integration.
   - **HTML & Bootstrap (Frontend)**: User interface.
   - **Model Integration**: Load the trained model for predictions.

3. **Deployment**
   - **Deploy Web App**: App hosted on **Heroku**.!
